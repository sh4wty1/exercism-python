# Exercism - Python Track 🐍

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io) Python track challenges.

## 📚 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice Python programming through structured exercises.
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking.
- Build a public portfolio to track my learning progress.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a single exercise, and contains:
- My implementation of the solution (`.py` file).
- (Optional) A brief explanation or notes in a local `README.md`.
